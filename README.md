# Grabbymon - Gotta Grab 'em All!!

This is a progressive demonstration application to illustrate how easy it is to go from "hello world" to a fully functioning microservice
that participates in a microservice ecosystem complete with external, revision controlled configuration and service discovery.

Each branch of this repository will contain additional code to correspond to successive steps in building on the initial hello world
application.

## Step Four - Dependency Injection and Repositories

In step 4, we take advantage of ASP.NET Core's built-in DI facility to inject a repository into the controller. At this point, the repository is an in-memory repository used only for demonstration/simulation purposes.
