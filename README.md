# Grabbymon - Gotta Grab 'em All!!

This is a progressive demonstration application to illustrate how easy it is to go from "hello world" to a fully functioning microservice
that participates in a microservice ecosystem complete with external, revision controlled configuration and service discovery.

Each branch of this repository will contain additional code to correspond to successive steps in building on the initial hello world
application.

## Step Three - Controllers

In step three, we take the middleware we created in the previous step and move it into a more familiar RESTful service concept - the _controller_.
